# Home_Automation_Emertxe


-->In this project I have automated 3 things in the smart home:
• Garden Lights Control: We have to turn on the garden lights at
night and turn off when in the morning sunlight automatically.
• Temperature Control System: Read the temperature from sensor. If
it is more than 35 degrees and the heater is on then turn off the
heater and send notification to Blynk IOT app and displaying it on
the CLCD.
• Water Tank Control: Read the volume of water in the tank. If the
volume for the water in the tank is less than 2000 litres turn on the
inlet valve and send notification to Blynk IOT app and display it on
the CLCD.
